If an Employee provided oral statements to support his or her request for paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave, the employer is required to document and retain such information for four years. If an employer denies an employee's request for leave pursuant to the small business exemption under § 826.40(b), the employer must document its authorized officer's determination that the prerequisite criteria for that exemption are satisfied and retain such documentation for four years. Section 826.140 also explains what documents the employer should create and retain to support its claim for tax credits from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)",
